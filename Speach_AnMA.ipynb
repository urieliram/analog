Furthermore, AnMA obtained its results in a dramatically shorter time of 4 seconds versus 16 seconds for ARMA. In addition, the computational economy of the AnMA method was very remarkable, with extraordinary results, using only one core of CPU and draws xx.xx kilo-watts.hour. as opposed to the ARMA model with eight cores and draws xx.xx kilo-watts.hour.

It boasts a remarkable calculation speed and can rival the accuracy of the best benchmarks. Furthermore, it has proven to be a computationally inexpensive algorithm falling into the \"green algorithms\" category. The AnMA method is the ideal combination of speed and accuracy, making it a highly desirable solution for electricity market forecasting. '+\\\n",

This makes the AnMA method a versatile tool tailored to different forecasting situations. '"
